                        <p>
                            Campus Map is an app designed for Penn State Students by a Penn State Student.<br><br>
                            It allows a user to locate any building on the Main PSU Campus.
                            When a building is selected its pin is displayed on the map. Tapping this pin displays the name, year-constructed, 
                            and image of the building. A route to this building from their current location or another set location can be generated.
                            The user can pin any location on the map and swipe between standard, hybrid, or satellite map views.
                        </p>

                            The stock market’s spikes and downfalls have mystified people since its inception, 
                            with nothing, machine or human, able to predict its future effectively. An AI Network 
                            called Aladdin controls over 7% of the entire world’s financial assets, which is almost 
                            the size of the U.S.’s total GDP!<br><br>I thought, why not take a crack at it?

                            A European travel guide was created in an SQL database management class as the final project. 
                            The goal was to apply our understanding of SQL to a hands-on project with a real-world application 
                            and UI. <br><br>Created with test driven development practices.
